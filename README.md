# CMWNet
   This project provides the code and results for 'Cross-Modal Weighting Network for RGB-D Salient Object Detection', ECCV 2020.
   
# Saliency maps and Measure results on 8 Datasets
   We provide [saliency maps](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ShP41pA04YEx_bLuBOlDHg) (提取码: 6f2j) and [measure results](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1gmswn6s7jbpj7byndanYhg) (提取码: p0y7) of our CMWNet on 8 datasets (STEREO, NJU2K, LFSD, DES, NLPR, SSD, SIP and additional DUT-RGBD).
   
# Testing
   The codes and models will come in soon.
